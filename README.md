# ProgrammingLanguages
Here are the programs written for my programming languages class. The first half of the assignments are haskell demonstrations and the 
second half are projects written in Racket. The final Racket project is to write our own interpreter using some of the built in 
lexing, parsing, and evaluation libraries to create a neat little drawing language.
